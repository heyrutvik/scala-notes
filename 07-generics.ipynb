    "In this notebook, we went through limited features of generic. We defined data structure (and method) using type parameter(s), been able to write operations where we don't need to use element values. We still need to review `type variance` and `type constraint` to fully leverage the mechanism of `Generics`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Re-define the `StringTree` (see `06-recursive-data` notebook) as `Tree` and use generics to create an instance of tree with any type of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define following method, `def divide[A, B](a: A, b: B): Int = a / b`. Guess the answer of `divide(4, 2)` expression before running it. Explain the evaluation, and errors (if any). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Declare a data structure from following statement. [hint: you may need to use two type parameters]\n",
    "    - a computation can hold a result of any type or it could fail and hold an error of any type\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. See the following snippet,\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   final case class Single[V](value: V)\n",
    "   final case class Tuple[A, B](a: A, b: Single[B])\n",
    "   final case class Triple[SomeTypeA, T, HELLO](a: SomeTypeA, b: Single[T], c: Tuple[T, HELLO])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   1. expand the type `Triple[Int, Boolean, String]`, what will be the concrete form?\n",
    "   2. if we initialize an object with `val t = Triple(1, Single(1.7), Tuple(2.1, Single(\"some string\")))`, \n",
    "       1. what will be the types of `SomeTypeA`, `T` and `HELLO` type parameter.\n",
    "       2. what will be the value of `t.c.b.a` and its type.\n",
    "   3. why `Triple(1, Single(1.7), Tuple(2.1f, Single(\"some string\")))` throws a compile time error.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Implement `concat` method for `List[A]` type. It should join the second list at the end of first list.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   val list1: List[Int] = Pair(1, Pair(2, Pair(3, End[Int]())))\n",
    "   val list2: List[Int] = Pair(4, Pair(5, Pair(6, End[Int]())))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   if inputs are `list1` and `list2`, then result of `concat(list1, list2)` should be `Pair(1, Pair(2, Pair(3, Pair(4, Pair(5, Pair(6, End[Int]()))))))`."

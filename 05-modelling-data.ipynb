But if we add methods, we may need to change existing code. In contrast, in functional style adding a new method doesn't need to change existing code. But adding new data will force us to change the existing code base. The example of it would be, imagine a sealed trait and adding a new case class to it, it will break all pattern matching on the traits.\n",
